> Makes the info windows on the bottom right more informal by untruncating the numbers it displays. <br>
> You can also quickly enable between viewing celsius and kelvin temperatures by holding "K" ingame. <br><br>
> also fixed a small bug with the day counter being "0" when you first enter a world. <br>

### FPS Counter Features: <br>
> FPS Text is now "*FPS* / *Cap* FPS" <br>
> FPS Cap will now actually be set (on caps below 60) and will not render numbers above the cap.<br>
> FPS Counter is a bit shorter due to removal of latency. <br>
