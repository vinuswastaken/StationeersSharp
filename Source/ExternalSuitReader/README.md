### Advanced Suit Logic Changes:
> Makes the advanced suit have the ability to read the external atmosphere of which the suit is in. <br>
> RatioOxygenOutput = Oxygen.<br>
> RatioLiquidOxygenOutput = LiquidOxygen<br>
> RatioNitrogenOutput = Nitrogen<br>
> RatioLiquidNitrogenOutput = LiquidNitrogen<br>
> RatioCarbonDioxideOutput = CarbonDioxide<br>
> RatioLiquidCarbonDioxideOutput = LiquidCarbonDioxide<br>
> RatioVolatilesOutput = Volatiles<br>
> RatioLiquidVolatilesOutput = LiquidVolatiles<br>
> RatioPollutantOutput = Pollutant<br>
> RatioLiquidPollutantOutput = LiquidPollutant<br>
> RatioNitrousOxideOutput = NitrousOxide<br>
> RatioLiquidNitrousOxideOutput = LiquidNitrousOxide<br>
> RatioSteamOutput = Steam<br>
> RatioWaterOutput = Water<br>
> RatioWaterOutput2 = PollutedWater (there isnt a RatioPollutedWaterOutput for some reason)
