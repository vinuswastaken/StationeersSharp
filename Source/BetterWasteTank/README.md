## BetterWasteTank:
### Waste Tank Changes
> Improves the wastetank by making the suit use the full potential of the canisters capacity. <br><br>
> Changes heating affect by lowering the amount of waste that goes into the waste tank when cooling the suit by 3 times. <br><br>
> The new max pressure of the waste tank is (*TankMaxPressure* - 101) <br><br>
> Regular Canister: *(10132.5 - 101)* = **10031.5kpa** <br>
> Smart Canister: *(20265 - 10)* = **20164kpa** <br>
> High Volume Canister: *(25331 - 101)* = **25130kpa** <br>
